## Disclaimer

This app is design-study therefore there isn't any active Services that retrieve Live NFT data and all the data seen in
the app is static data 

## Future Works

The following will be implemented in the next version of the App

* Build a NFT Service for the following requirements:
    * Search Nfts
    * Filter Nfts
    * Retrive Nfts based on address
    * Retrieve NFT metadata

* Integrate ARKit and RealityKit to view the NFT in an Augmented Space

* Connect your wallet like (MetaMask)
